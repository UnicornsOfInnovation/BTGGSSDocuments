	Database Limitations since it is not deployed on the web
	 - one account at a time. So you can only open one page and login one user at a time.
 	 - Server Controller Error: Null upon adding. This is due to Database limitations when not deployed on web.
		- when this error persists, delete entry in the database (link found in manual) and re enter the details.
		- this happens often times.
